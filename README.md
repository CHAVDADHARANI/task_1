# Task 1: Cybersecurity Basics & Attack Surface

## Project Overview
This project provides a foundational understanding of cybersecurity principles, identifying threat actors, and mapping attack surfaces across modern digital infrastructures.

## Deliverables
- **Cybersecurity_Basics.pdf**: A detailed 4-5 page report covering:
    - The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
    - Threat Actor Profiles.
    - Attack Surface Analysis (Web, Mobile, Cloud, Network).
    - Data Flow Security Mapping.
    - OWASP Top 10 Summary.

## How to Use This Research
1. **Study the CIA Triad**: Use it as a lens to evaluate any new technology.
2. **Review the Attack Surface**: Apply the "Data Flow" logic to your daily apps (Email, Banking) to see where they might be vulnerable.
3. **Reference OWASP**: Use the OWASP Top 10 as a checklist when reviewing web application security.

## Tools Used
- Web Browser (Chrome/Firefox)
- OWASP Foundation Resources
- Google Cybersecurity Blog
